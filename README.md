# An online magazine template

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
ReactJS and React Router are applied for this frontend repo. To start, please run <code>npm start</code>.

The template demonstrates grid layouts and a navigation bar that links to various categories, used effectively on online media sites. Also, there are a contact page and a page titled '網民熱話' (Hot Topic on online forums), which scrapes data from several local popular forums by using Puppeteer.

<b>Scraping feature by Puppeteer</b>

It scrapes data from three local online forums instantly on page load. To launch, please start the backend-puppeteer server first (GitHub <a href="https://github.com/Dic21/puppeteer-forum-scraper">HERE</a>). The page illustrates three tables of top forum posts on each sources and a wordcloud showing the mentioned terms with high frequency.
